# CLICSV

I was tired of having to open up a spreadsheet editor when working with data in the terminal, and I wanted to get more familiar with the rust programming language so I decided to make this. It's a command-line csv text editor written in rust. Currently a work in progress and needs refactoring, but is functional.
